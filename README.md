# CIS4282_BasicNodeSetup

This project was developed for an Independent Study under Professor Sally Kyvernitis http://cis-linux2.temple.edu/~sallyk/#/Node

I used Node.js to create a simple backend using express. The API call in this project is a basic getAllUsers call to that returns a JSON list of users in the database.
